Python Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation

**pyesmda** is an open-source, pure python, and object-oriented library that provides
a user friendly implementation of one of the most popular ensemble based method
for parameters estimation and data assimilation: the Ensemble Smoother with
Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) algorithm, introduced by Emerick and Reynolds [1-2].

Thanks to its simple formulation, ES-MDA of Emerick and Reynolds (2012) is perhaps the
most used iterative form of the ensemble smoother in geoscience applications.
