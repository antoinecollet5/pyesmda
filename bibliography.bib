  abstract = {There has been great progress in data assimilation within atmospheric and oceanographic sciences during the last couple of decades. In data assimilation, one aims at merging the information from observations into a numerical model, typically of a geophysical system. A typical example where data assimilation is needed is in weather forecasting. Here, the atmospheric models must take into account the most recent observations of variables such as temperature and atmospheric pressure for better forecasting of the weather in the next time period. A major challenge for these models is that they contain very large numbers of variables.The progress in data assimilation is because of both increased computational power and the introduction of techniques that are capable of handling large amounts of data and more severe nonlinearities. The aim of this paper is to focus on one of these techniques, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The EnKF has been introduced to petroleum science recently (Lorentzen et al. 2001a) and, in particular, has attracted attention as a promising method for solving the history matching problem. The literature available on the EnKF is now rather overwhelming. We hope that this review will help researchers (and students) working on adapting the EnKF to petroleum applications to find valuable references and ideas, although the number of papers discussing the EnKF is too large to give a complete review. For practitioners, we have cited critical EnKF papers from weather and oceanography. We have also tried to review most of the papers dealing with the EnKF and updating of reservoir models available to the authors by the beginning of 2008.The EnKF is based on the simpler Kalman filter (Kalman 1960). We will start by introducing the Kalman filter. The Kalman filter is an efficient recursive filter that estimates the state of a linear dynamical system from a series of noisy measurements. The Kalman filter is based on a model equation, where the current state of the system is associated with an uncertainty (expressed by a covariance matrix) and an observation equation that relates a linear combination of the states to measurements. The measurements are also associated with uncertainty. The model equations are used to compute a forward step (Eqs. 1 and 2) where the state variables are computed forward in time with the current estimate of the state as initial condition. The observation equations are used in the analysis step (Eqs. 3 through 5) where the estimated value of the state and its uncertainty are corrected to take into account the most recent measurements See, e.g., Cohn (1997), Maybeck (1979), or Stengel (1994) for an introduction to the Kalman filter.},

  abstract = {Good performance with small ensemble filters applied to models with many state variables may require `localizing' the impact of an observation to state variables that are `close' to the observation. As a step in developing nearly generic ensemble filter assimilation systems, a method to estimate `localization' functions is presented. Localization is viewed as a means to ameliorate sampling error when small ensembles are used to sample the statistical relation between an observation and a state variable. The impact of spurious sample correlations between an observation and model state variables is estimated using a `hierarchical ensemble filter', where an ensemble of ensemble filters is used to detect sampling error. Hierarchical filters can adapt to a wide array of ensemble sizes and observational error characteristics with only limited heuristic tuning. Hierarchical filters can allow observations to efficiently impact state variables, even when the notion of `distance' between the observation and the state variables cannot be easily defined. For instance, defining the distance between an observation of radar reflectivity from a particular radar and beam angle taken at 1133~GMT and a model temperature variable at 700~hPa 60~km north of the radar beam at 1200~GMT is challenging. The hierarchical filter estimates sampling error from a `group' of ensembles and computes a factor between 0 and 1 to minimize sampling error. An a priori notion of distance is not required. Results are shown in both a low-order model and a simple atmospheric GCM. For low-order models, the hierarchical filter produces `localization' functions that are very similar to those already described in the literature. When observations are more complex or taken at different times from the state specification (in ensemble smoothers for instance), the localization functions become increasingly distinct from those used previously. In the GCM, this complexity reaches a level that suggests that it would be difficult to define efficient localization functions a priori. There is a cost trade-off between running hierarchical filters or running a traditional filter with larger ensemble size. Hierarchical filters can be run for short training periods to develop localization statistics that can be used in a traditional ensemble filter to produce high quality assimilations at reasonable cost, even when the relation between observations and state variables is not well-known a priori. Additional research is needed to determine if it is ever cost-efficient to run hierarchical filters for large data assimilation problems instead of traditional filters with the corresponding total number of ensemble members.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, ensemble-based methods have been widely investigated and applied for data assimilation of flow problems associated with atmospheric physics and petroleum reservoir history matching. This paper focuses entirely on the reservoir history-matching problem. Among the ensemble-based methods, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is the most popular for history-matching applications. However, the recurrent simulation restarts required in the EnKF sequential data assimilation process may prevent the use of EnKF when the objective is to incorporate the history matching in an integrated geo-modeling workflow. In this situation, the ensemble smoother (ES) is a viable alternative. However, because ES computes a single global update, it may not result in acceptable data matches; therefore, the development of efficient iterative forms of ES is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose to assimilate the same data multiple times with an inflated measurement error covariance matrix in order to improve the results obtained by ES. This method is motivated by the equivalence between single and multiple data assimilation for the linear-Gaussian case. We test the proposed method for three synthetic reservoir history-matching problems. Our results show that the proposed method provides better data matches than those obtained with standard ES and EnKF, with a computational cost comparable with the computational cost of EnKF.},

However, it is known that EnKF may fail to give acceptable data matches especially for highly nonlinear problems. In this paper, we introduce a procedure to improve EnKF data matches based on assimilating the same data multiple times with the covariance matrix of the measurement errors multiplied by the number of data assimilations. We prove the equivalence between single and multiple data assimilations for the linear-Gaussian case and present computational evidence that multiple data assimilations can improve EnKF estimates for the nonlinear case. The proposed procedure was tested by assimilating time-lapse seismic data in two synthetic reservoir problems, and the results show significant improvements compared to the standard EnKF. In addition, we review the inversion schemes used in the EnKF analysis and present a rescaling procedure to avoid loss of information during the truncation of small singular values.},

  abstract = {Data Assimilation comprehensively covers data assimilation and inverse methods, including both traditional state estimation and parameter estimation. This text and reference focuses on various popular data assimilation methods, such as weak and strong constraint variational methods and ensemble filters and smoothers. It is demonstrated how the different methods can be derived from a common theoretical basis, as well as how they differ and/or are related to each other, and which properties characterize them, using several examples. It presents the mathematical framework and derivations in a way which is common for any discipline where dynamics is merged with measurements. The mathematics level is modest, although it requires knowledge of basic spatial statistics, Bayesian statistics, and calculus of variations. Readers will also appreciate the introduction to the mathematical methods used and detailed derivations, which should be easy to follow, are given throughout the book. The codes used in several of the data assimilation experiments are available on a web page. The focus on ensemble methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter and smoother, also makes it a solid reference to the derivation, implementation and application of such techniques. Much new material, in particular related to the formulation and solution of combined parameter and state estimation problems and the general properties of the ensemble algorithms, is available here for the first time. The 2nd edition includes a partial rewrite of Chapters 13 an 14, and the Appendix. In addition, there is a completely new Chapter on "Spurious correlations, localization and inflation", and an updated and improved sampling discussion in Chap 11.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on the construction, directly in physical space, of simply parametrized covariance functions for data-assimilation applications. A self-contained, rigorous mathematical summary of relevant topics from correlation theory is provided as a foundation for this construction. Covariance and correlation functions are defined, and common notions of homogeneity and isotropy are clarified. Classical results are stated, and proven where instructive. Included are smoothness properties relevant to multivariate statistical-analysis algorithms where wind/wind and wind/mass correlation models are obtained by differentiating the correlation model of a mass variable. the Convolution Theorem is introduced as the primary tool used to construct classes of covariance and cross-covariance functions on three-dimensional Euclidean space R3. Among these are classes of compactly supported functions that restrict to covariance and cross-covariance functions on the unit sphere S2, and that vanish identically on subsets of positive measure on S2. It is shown that these covariance and cross-covariance functions on S2, referred to as being space-limited, cannot be obtained using truncated spectral expansions. Compactly supported and space-limited covariance functions determine sparse covariance matrices when evaluated on a grid, thereby easing computational burdens in atmospheric data-analysis algorithms. Convolution integrals leading to practical examples of compactly supported covariance and cross-covariance functions on R3 are reduced and evaluated. More specifically, suppose that gi and gj are radially symmetric functions defined on R3 such that gi(x) = 0 for |x| {$>$} di and gj(x) = 0 for |xv {$>$} dj, O {$<$} di,dj {$\leqq$}, where |. | denotes Euclidean distance in R3. the parameters di and dj are `cut-off' distances. Closed-form expressions are determined for classes of convolution cross-covariance functions Cij(x,y) := (gi * gj)(x-y), i {$\neq$} j, and convolution covariance functions Cii(x,y) := (gi * gi)(x-y), vanishing for |x - y| {$>$} di + dj and |x - y| {$>$} 2di, respectively, Additional covariance functions on R3 are constructed using convolutions over the real numbers R, rather than R3. Families of compactly supported approximants to standard second- and third-order autoregressive functions are constructed as illustrative examples. Compactly supported covariance functions of the form C(x,y) := Co(|x - y|), x,y {$\in$} R3, where the functions Co(r) for r {$\in$} R are 5th-order piecewise rational functions, are also constructed. These functions are used to develop space-limited product covariance functions B(x, y) C(x, y), x, y {$\in$} S2, approximating given covariance functions B(x, y) supported on all of S2 \texttimes{} S2.},

The strategy consists of: (i) an adaptive choice for the regularisation parameter in the update formula in EKI, and (ii) criteria for the early stopping of the scheme. In contrast to existing approaches, our parameter choice does not rely on additional tuning parameters which often have severe effects on the efficiency of EKI. We motivate our approach using the interpretation of EKI as a Gaussian approximation in the Bayesian tempering setting for inverse problems. We show that our parameter choice controls the symmetrised Kullback\textendash Leibler divergence between consecutive tempering measures. We further motivate our choice using a heuristic statistical discrepancy principle. We test our framework using electrical impedance tomography with the complete electrode model. Parameterisations of the unknown conductivity are employed which enable us to characterise both smooth or a discontinuous (piecewise-constant) fields. We show numerically that the proposed regularisation of EKI can produce efficient, robust and accurate estimates, even for the discontinuous case which tends to require larger ensembles and more iterations to converge. We compare the proposed technique with a standard method of choice and demonstrate that the proposed method is a viable choice to address computational efficiency of EKI in practical/operational settings.},

With computational examples, they demonstrated that ES-MDA provides both a better data match and a better quantification of uncertainty than is obtained with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). However, similar to EnKF, ESMDA can experience near ensemble collapse and results in too many extreme values of rock-property fields for complex problems. These negative effects can be avoided by a judicious choice of the ES-MDA inflation factors, but, before this work, the optimal inflation factors could only be determined by trial and error. Here, we provide two automatic procedures for choosing the inflation factor for the next data-assimilation step adaptively as the history match proceeds. Both methods are motivated by knowledge of regularization procedures\textemdash the first is intuitive and heuristical; the second is motivated by existing theory on the regularization of least-squares inverse problems. We illustrate that the adaptive ES-MDA algorithms are superior to the original ES-MDA algorithm by history matching three-phase-flow production data for a complicated synthetic problem in which the reservoir-model parameters include the porosity, horizontal and vertical permeability fields, depths of the initial fluid contacts, and the parameters of power-law permeability curves.},

  abstract = {Ensemble-based history matching methods are among the state-of-the-art approaches to reservoir characterization. In practice, however, they often suffer from ensemble collapse, a phenomenon that deteriorates history matching performance. To prevent ensemble collapse, it is customary to equip an ensemble history matching algorithm with a certain localization scheme. In a previous study, the authors propose an adaptive localization scheme that exploits the correlations between model variables and simulated observations. Correlation-based adaptive localization not only overcomes some longstanding issues (e.g., the challenges in handling non-local or time-lapse observations) arising in the conventional distance-based localization, but also is more convenient and flexible to use in real field case studies. In applications, however, correlation-based localization is also found to be subject to two problems. One is that, it requires to run a relatively large ensemble in order to achieve decent performance in an automatic manner, which becomes computationally expensive in large-scale problems. As a result, certain empirical tuning factors are introduced to reduce the computational costs. The other problem is that, the way used to compute the tapering coefficients in the previous study may induce discontinuities, and neglect the information of certain still-influential observations for model updates. The main objective of this work is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of correlation-based adaptive localization, making it run in an automatic manner but without incurring substantial extra computational costs. To this end, we introduce two enhancements that aim to avoid the aforementioned two problems, namely, empirical tuning and discontinuities. We apply the resulting automatic and adaptive correlation-based localization with these two enhancements to a 2D and a 3D cases investigated in the previous study, and show that it leads to better history matching performance (in terms of efficiency and/or estimation accuracy) than that is achieved in the previous work.},

  abstract = {Practical data assimilation algorithms often contain hyper-parameters, which may arise due to, for instance, the use of certain auxiliary techniques like covariance inflation and localization in an ensemble Kalman filter, the re-parameterization of certain quantities such as model and/or observation error covariance matrices, and so on. Given the richness of the established assimilation algorithms, and the abundance of the approaches through which hyper-parameters are introduced to the assimilation algorithms, one may ask whether it is possible to develop a sound and generic method to efficiently choose various types of (sometimes high-dimensional) hyper-parameters. This work aims to explore a feasible, although likely partial, answer to this question. Our main idea is built upon the notion that a data assimilation algorithm with hyper-parameters can be considered as a parametric mapping that links a set of quantities of interest (e.g., model state variables and/or parameters) to a corresponding set of predicted observations in the observation space. As such, the choice of hyper-parameters can be recast as a parameter estimation problem, in which our objective is to tune the hyper-parameters in such a way that the resulted predicted observations can match the real observations to a good extent. From this perspective, we propose a hyper-parameter estimation workflow and investigate the performance of this workflow in an ensemble Kalman filter. In a series of experiments, we observe that the proposed workflow works efficiently even in the presence of a relatively large amount (up to 103) of hyper-parameters, and exhibits reasonably good and consistent performance under various conditions.},

Los resultados muestran la capacidad del m\'etodo propuesto de resolver este tipo de problemas; el rendimiento de ES-MDA mejora, especialmente para tama\~nos de conjuntos peque\~nos, cuando se aplican t\'ecnicas de inflaci\'on y localizaci\'on de covarianza.
 La segunda aplicaci\'on en el campo de las aguas superficiales se refiere a la calibraci\'on de un modelo hidrol\'ogico-hidr\'aulico que simula los mecanismos de formaci\'on de eventos de inundaci\'on. ES-MDA se acopla al modelo num\'erico de forma paralela para la estimaci\'on de los coeficientes de rugosidad e infiltraci\'on en base al conocimiento de un hidrograma de flujo en una secci\'on del dominio. Los resultados de dos casos sint\'eticos y un estudio de caso real demuestran la capacidad del m\'etodo propuesto para calibrar el modelo hidrol\'ogico-hidr\'aulico con un tiempo computacional razonable.
 En el campo de aguas subterr\'aneas, ES-MDA se aplica por primera vez para identificar simult\'aneamente la ubicaci\'on de la fuente y el historial de liberaci\'on de un contaminante en un acu\'ifero a partir de datos de concentraci\'on detectados en diferentes puntos del dominio. Se realizaron numerosas pruebas para evaluar la influencia de la distribuci\'on espacial y temporal de los datos de concentraci\'on, el n\'umero del conjunto y el uso de t\'ecnicas de localizaci\'on e inflaci\'on; adem\'as, se presenta un nuevo procedimiento para realizar una localizaci\'on iterativa espacio-temporal. La metodolog\'ia se valida mediante un ejemplo anal\'itico y un estudio de caso que utiliza datos obtenidos en el laboratorio mediante una caja de arena. ES-MDA conduce a una buena estimaci\'on de los par\'ametros investigados; una red de monitoreo bien dise\~nada y la aplicaci\'on de correcciones de covarianza mejoran el rendimiento del m\'etodo y ayudan a mitigar el posible problema de no unicidad de la soluci\'on.
 Otro prop\'osito de la tesis es investigar el efecto del cambio clim\'atico en las aguas subterr\'aneas. Se presenta un modelo simplificado que describe la respuesta de los niveles de agua subterr\'anea a las variables meteorol\'ogicas hasta 2100. Es un enfoque estad\'istico sencillo basado en las correlaciones entre los niveles de agua subterr\'anea y dos \'indices de sequ\'ia que dependen de los datos de precipitaci\'on y temperatura. El m\'etodo se utiliza para evaluar el impacto del cambio clim\'atico en los recursos de agua subterr\'anea en un \'area de estudio ubicada en el norte de Italia utilizando datos hist\'oricos y de modelos clim\'aticos regionales.

  abstract = {Ensemble Kalman filter methods have been successfully applied for data assimilation and parameter estimation through inverse modeling in various scientific fields. We have developed a new generic software package for the solution of inverse problems implementing the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (genES-MDA). It is an open-source, platform-independent Python-based program. Its aim is to facilitate the management and configuration of the ES-MDA through several programming tools that help in the preparation of the different steps of ES-MDA. genES-MDA has a flexible workflow that can be easily adapted for the implementation of different variants of the ensemble Kalman filter and for the solution of generic inverse problems. This paper presents a description of the package and some application examples. genES-MDA has been tested in three synthetic case studies: the solution of the reverse flow routing for the estimation of the inflow hydrograph to a river reach using observed water levels and a calibrated forward model of the river system, the identification of a hydraulic conductivity field using piezometric observations and a known forward flow model, and the estimation of the release history of a contaminant spill in an aquifer from measured concentration data and a known flow and transport model. The results of all these tests have demonstrated the flexibility of genES-MDA and its capabilities to efficiently solve different types of inverse problems.},
